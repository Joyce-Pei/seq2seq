Investigate Predictive AAC with Sequence to Sequence Network on Small Conversational Datasets
An Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) device is a tablet or laptop that helps someone with a speech or language impairment to communicate. 
Making good questionanswer predictions can help accelerate the communication.
In this project, I investigate RNN, GRU, LSTM under Encoder Decoder Network, with both regular decoder and attention decoder.
The Word Error Rate shows that Sequence to Sequence Network, especially Attention RNN, which is trained on small conversational
data sets, can provide promising results on AAC deviceâ€™s question-answer pair predictions.
